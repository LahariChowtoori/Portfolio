Central to our analysis was GDP and its relation to key factors such as population, trade, agriculture, and the correlation of economic growth with investments in education, healthcare, industrial, and agricultural activities. In our report we have produced valuable insights into the economic and demographic profiles of different countries. A particular emphasis was placed on the role of industrial activities and research and development in shaping economic growth. This endeavor not only sheds light on current economic and social conditions but also serves as a valuable tool for policymakers and researchers in strategizing for future developmental trajectories.",
